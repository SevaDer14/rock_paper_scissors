## User Stories

## Developer Stories

As a dev  
To have a better code  
I want a separate file with all functions related to logic  

As a dev  
To save time and improve code  
I want to have 6 icons for jests, color coded for winning or loosing hand

As a dev  
To build more welcoming experience  
I want to display welcome form, asking a user to input his/her name

## Final Goal

- function file: has all necessary logic: winner determination and score keeping
- instaed of words, app uses icons for Rock, Paper and Scissors jests
- main window has two screens that show player and PC jest, with backgrownd color that Green - winner, Red - looser
- on the left there is a table with history of the game and total score

## Priorities

1) Logic (no logic - no game)
2) Primitive text-based UI just to play the game (no score keeping)
3) User can login with his/her name of choice
4) Better UI - Using icons and colors
5) Total score - User vs. PC
6) History of steps
